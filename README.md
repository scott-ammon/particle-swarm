# Particle Swarm Optimization with three.js
Demo site I built to learn how to use three.js. Runs a particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve for the minimum of various equations. 
All of the sample equations can be solved directly, without the need of an optimization algorithm - this was just a fun way to visualize the process in three dimensions.
