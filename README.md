# Particle Swarm Optimization with three.js

Visualization of a PSO algorithm solving for global minima of simple 3D surfaces. These examples are contrived, as they can be solved for directly, but this provides a fun way to visualize how a PSO algorithm uses a population of particles to collectively search multi-variate objective functions for minima/maxima.

The visualization is generated using three.js, a JavaScript library that uses WebGL under the hood to generate 2D/3D graphics in the browser.
